Dockerizing WordPress with Dockerfile, Docker Compose, and Database Optimization
The goal is to Dockerize a WordPress application using best practices for Dockerfile and Docker Compose, as well as to optimize the database for improved performance.

Approach for Dockerizing WordPress : Gone through the official Docker documentation on WordPress & write the Dockerfile and docker-Compose.yml file with the help of the documentation and some of my prior knowledge on networking and docker.

Approach for optimizing the database : Research about different database optimization strategies. Having the basic knowledge of MYSQL queries given a big advantage.

Challenges encountered during the process : My laptop was having some issues related to storage. So, i had to used a ubuntu instance on AWS ec2.


# Deployment

## Task 1 Dockerfile for WordPress


To create the docker image 

```bash
  docker build -t Wordpress .

```
To run container from image 
```bash
  docker run -p 8080:80 --name Wordpress-container Wordpress 
```
To get access of the website just hit the following url in the browser

        "http://localhost:8080"

## Task 2 Docker Compose File

### Configure Environment Variables
 Create a .env file in the project's root directory and set the necessary environment variables:
   ```bash
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_root_password
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=your_wordpress_db_password
   ```


### To Create a Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml) to orchestrate the WordPress application.
 
 To start containers defined in a 'docker-compose.yml'
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To get access of the application just hit the following url in the browser.

    "http://localhost:8080"

To get access of mysql.

    "http://localhost:8081"

## Task 3 
 To access the MySQL Container
 ```bash
     docker exec -it my-mysql bash
 ```
 To login to MySQL and enter the password
```bash
   mysql -u root -p 
```
To show 
To use databse and showing the tables
```bash
  show database;
  use wordpress;
  show table;
```
To Analyze Query Performance : Identify slow-running queries using the EXPLAIN statement:
```bash
   EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM wp_posts WHERE post_status = 'publish;
```
Indexing : Identify frequently used columns adding indexes to them
```bash
CREATE INDEX idx_title ON wp_posts (post_title);
```
Ensure that each table has a primary key
```bash
  ALTER TABLE wp_posts ADD PRIMARY KEY (ID);
```
Optimize Queries : Only retrieve the columns needed
```bash
  SELECT post_title, post_date FROM wp_posts WHERE post_status = 'publish';
```
Regular Maintenance : Analyze and Optimize Tables
```bash
    ANALYZE TABLE wp_posts;
    OPTIMIZE TABLE wp_posts;
```
Remove Unnecessary Data : Remove unused data to reduce the size of your database.

Partitioning : Partitioning them to distribute data across multiple partitions.

Monitor Performance : Continuously monitor the performance of database using tools like MySQL Workbench and Zabbix.
